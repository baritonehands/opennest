opennest
========

OpenNest, an open source thermostat

**Installation**

**Icons and Font**

I don't have permission to distribute the icons and font on GitHub, so you'll have to download them separately.

[Bariol font](http://www.bariol.com/) (free with a tweet)


**Mac OS X**

On Mac, all you need is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install the Qt dependencies:

```
$> brew install pyqt
```

You also need [pywapi](https://code.google.com/p/python-weather-api/#Building) from Google Code.
